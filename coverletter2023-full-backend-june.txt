Hello there,

I am a hands-on senior software engineer with past experience at SAP, Microsoft, AOL, and other leading companies. With strong expertise of Go/Java/C++ and distributed systems, i developed distributed backend services, data replication and high available data services, RESTful api and web sites backend. My recent projects make extensive use of AWS (S3, SNS, SQS, Dynamodb, EMR, EKS, CDK, etc.), Docker, Kafka, serverless, Kubernetes and Helm. I am really interested in your projects and writing to apply to join the team working remotely from Seattle, WA.

For a sampling of my coding, here are some open source projects i worked on:

1. https://github.com/yglcode: recent projects, such as works with AWS jsii toolkit golang binding (https://github.com/aws/jsii/pull/2780), HashiCorp golang-lru package (https://github.com/hashicorp/golang-lru/pull/80), kafka work queue support for OpenFaas using Golang and docker swarm, and AWS CDK (Infra As Code) construct library for renaming stack and resources.
2. https://github.com/go-router: open source Golang package for pub/sub message passing and scalable services construction.

I am a US citizen and can legally work for your projects.

Thanks for your considerations.

Yigong
